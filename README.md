# AI Integrated Savings

This project is a demo frontend for a savings tool built to help users reduce unnecessary expenses and learn more about AI-driven financial insights. It was originally designed as part of a hackathon and continues to be improved as a standalone project. The site contains multiple informational pages that help users learn how AI can be used to evaluate subscriptions, track spending, and recommend savings strategies.

The goal was to build a professional, multi-page site that shares a unified brand across all pages using a shared navigation bar and consistent design system. This project showcases skills in frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS) and basic Flask backend setup.
