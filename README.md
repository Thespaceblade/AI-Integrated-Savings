## 🧠 About the Project

This project was developed as a prototype solution for the **Capital One Case Competition**, where our team was challenged to present a tool that empowers users to understand and manage their digital financial commitments more clearly.

We focused on creating a visually clean and data-focused interface that could eventually be scaled to include real-time sync with banking APIs and machine learning predictions on future spending.
